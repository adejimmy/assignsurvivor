//Declares a

//The defaultRequestChannel attribute of @MessagingGateway indicates that any
//messages resulting from a call to the interface methods should be sent to the given
//message channel. In this case, you state that any messages that result from a call to
//writeToFile() should be sent to the channel whose name is textInChannel

    //As for the writeToFile() method, it accepts a filename as a String and another
  //String that is to contain the text that should be written to a file. Whatâ€™s notable about
  //this method signature is that the filename parameter is annotated with @Header. In
  //this case, the @Header annotation indicates that the value passed to filename should
  //be placed in a message header (specified as FileHeaders.FILENAME, which resolves
  //to file_name) rather than in the message payload. The data parameter value, on the
  //other hand, is carried in the message payload
